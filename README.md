# Mentalhealth
There is a growing demand for automatizing the process of analyzing the users' sentiments 
towards many areas including customer services, health care, marketing, politics... for the 
purpose of understanding people’s opinions and emotions more thoroughly. In the field of 
artificial intelligence and natural language processing, sentiment analysis (SA) is used to 
facilitate this process. One out of every four adults in the United States suffers from a mental 
health condition, making mental health a significant priority. In the research paper, sentiment 
analysis is researched to apply its application into the mental health industry to predict 
depression level and mental health status of users in a specific period to recommend the 
appropriate early treatment. We use data collected from other research to first develop an 
automatic processing algorithm to score on Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), to first
better understand how positive and negative messages that users want to share with others and to 
then relate this sentiment analysis to mental health conditions. For researching the effectiveness
of applying sentiment analysis on early diagnose of mental illness, an automatic system is 
proposed using sentiment analysis and machine learning method to test the accuracy.
The data collected for training model is secondary data, which does not include the important 
features including background, demographic, time data collected… to predict more accurate 
diagnose. Recognizing these limitations, future work will expand the methods to collect data so 
that it is more trackable from diverse sources to improve the accuracy rate of system.
